# Mini Assignment: Recursion

Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of any number.  The API should be as follows:

```
def factorial(num):
```

Write a small code block that uses your function to calculate the factorial of the following numbers:

* 5
* 8
* 20
* 100
* 999

At some point, one of these is going to fail with a "maximum recursion depth reached" message.  When this happens, simply note it rather than the answer.  You may want to wrap the function call in a try/catch to prevent a huge stack trace.


**Do not look at the solution to this on the Internet.  You may get help from other students, but you cannot look up a recursive algorithm for factorials.  You need to think this logic through yourself.**
