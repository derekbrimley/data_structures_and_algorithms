# Mid-Semester Project

Use a principle from 537 (array, list, circular list, etc.) in a real-world case.  Ideally, this should be a consulting or other project you are working on.  If you have previously solve a problem like this, update it with the principles you've learned in this class.  Be sure your problem does the following:

* Adresses a real-world, interesting problem.  Solves it elegantly.
* Cleverly showcases a principle from this class: stack, queues, a sorting algorithm, a searching algorithm, recursion, etc.
* Is simple enough to present in 3-5 slides (even if it is part of a larger project, only showcase this one part of the system).
* Highlights the implementation and algorithm (this is an implementation assignment).

If you do not currently have an outside project of this type, pick a principle from the class and find where it might be used in the real world.  Program an implementation that is clever and interesting.

## The Presentation

Once your implementation is finished, create a presentation that shows your example to the class.  Your presentation should contain 3-5 slides of introduction/description/background, a short code walkthough, and a running example.  Your presentation should be 5-10 minutes.

Give the presentation to the class on October 18 or October 25.  We'll have 10 presentations per day.  The class will, in part, grade your presentation.

## Grading

Your project (and presentation) will be graded on the following factors:

* The problem.  *Is it interesting to the class?  Is it difficult?  Is it a real problem to some company or society?  Why do we (or someone or some group) care?*
* Your solution.  *Does it solve the problem?  Is it clever?  Is it efficient?  Does it use a principle from IS 537?  Is your code elegant?*
* Your presentation.  *Was it interesting?  Did you clearly present your code?  Did the class understand the problem and solution? Did you stay within the time limits?*
