# Mini Assignment: Profile Code

Find a profiling library for your language.  Apply this profiler to a project you are working on, or at the very least, to your array and linked list assignments.  Submit your profiling code and the output.  For example, your output should show which method calls happen the most, which take the most time, which use the most memory, and so forth.  

Figure out what library is the most widely-usd one in your language, and use it the "right" way. If multiple profiling libraries exist, use the "right" one for your situation. Note that due to the variety of languages and profiling libraries, I will grade your submission based on what your library can do rather than looking for specific attributes. 


## Submitting the Assignment

Compile your source code and your output into a format that makes the most sense for grading.  Upload your file(s) to Learning Suite under this assignment.
